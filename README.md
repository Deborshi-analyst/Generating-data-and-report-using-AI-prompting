# Generating-data-and-report-using-AI-prompting
 - Basic AI Prompting to generate a dataset on a perticular subject followed by a report based on that dataset. I used only two AI tools namely Google gemini
   ([Link of the conversation](https://g.co/gemini/share/4c7e7a81e3c1)) and Microsoft Copilot ([Link of the conversation](https://copilot.microsoft.com/shares/D75iRaj3sKrgkQqQ6jSHs)).

 - This project is sourced from one of my [previous project](https://github.com/Deborshi-analyst/Popular-play-store-app-developer-analytics-using-excel#popular-play-store-app-developer-analytics-using-excel) but        here I excluded using the Excel.

 - As it was not possible to generate the [report](https://github.com/Deborshi-analyst/Generating-data-and-report-using-AI-prompting/blob/main/generated%20report%20using%20ai%20prompting.pdf) directly to PDF format,    instead I generated HTML code and later downloaded it in PDF format with the help of an online HTML coding [site](https://html.onlineviewer.net/).
